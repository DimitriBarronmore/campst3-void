Campfire Stories 3: Limbo Harder

What do you do when the world around you turns upside down? How do you get on with no one to talk to, no wood to punch, and no sense of time?

The void has no features, no day/night cycle, and is intended to have no ability to set spawnpoints and a relatively small world border to encourage people to build close to each other. You cannot sleep in the void, and dying in another dimension will send you careening back there. 

This pack is best played on a server with the ability to schedule regular commands. When you first create a world, reload your functions and run /function cs3:setup; this will change the world spawn to 0,0 and set up the global respawn system. Once the function cs3:countdown has been run enough times, by default 72 hours if the command is run every five minutes, every dimension other than the void will be deleted and regenerated. 

NOTE: To download the mods involved, a small python script originally created by Ally and modified heavily by myself is included. Simply run getmods.py, and it will populate the /mods folder for you. If you ever want to update your downloaded mods to the latest versions, run updatemods.py and it'll seek out new versions.
