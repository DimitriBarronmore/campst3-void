Campfire Stories 3: Limbo Harder

Let's put this pack together, shall we? Clone this repo to the .minecraft folder of whatever instance you're using.
The goal is to test things off branches. When you're adding a new batch of mods, make a branch, and then we can pull them all together once the individual sets are tested thorougly. 

NOTE: To download the mods involved, a small python script originally created by Ally and modified heavily by myself is included. Simply run getmods.py, and it will populate the /mods folder for you. If you ever want to update your downloaded mods to the latest versions, run updatemods.py and it'll seek out new versions.

In order to run the modloader, you must first install the Requests library:
python -m pip install -U requests
