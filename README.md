Campfire Stories 3: Trapped in the Void

Let's put this pack together, shall we? Clone this repo to the .minecraft folder of whatever instance you're using.
The goal is to test things off branches. When you're adding a new batch of mods, make a branch, and then we can pull them all together once the individual sets are tested thorougly. 

NOTE: To download the mods involved, you must now run a small python script originally created by Ally and modified heavily by myself. If this doesn't work, a mod list is inherently provided.
